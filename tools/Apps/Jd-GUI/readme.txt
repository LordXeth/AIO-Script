JD-GUI is a standalone graphical utility that displays Java source codes of 
".class" files. You can browse the reconstructed source code with the JD-GUI
for instant access to methods and fields.

JD-GUI is free for non-commercial use. This means that JD-GUI shall not be

5. Uninstallation
 5.1 Windows: Delete "jd-gui.exe" and "jd-gui.cfg".
 5.2 Linux: Delete "jd-gui" application file and "jd-gui.cfg".
 5.3 OSX: Drag and drop "JD-GUI" application to the trash.

6. Network & Security
JD-GUI is a single instance application. When a second instance is started, 
its parameters are sent to the first instance and it stops. This allows, to 
the first instance, to show the sources of the ".class" file that you double-
clicked.

To do this, the first instance creates a socket server, listening on 
127.0.0.1:12008 and the next instances created a socket to the same endpoint. 
Inter-process communications are local to the host. No data is sent or 
received from the Internet.
